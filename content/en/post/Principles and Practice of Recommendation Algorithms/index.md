Since the recommendation algorithm I use is based on collaborative filtering, let's discuss collaborative filtering algorithms.

Collaborative Filtering (CF) is one of the most classic recommendation algorithms and has been revolutionary for recommendation systems. The collaborative filtering algorithm was first proposed in 1992.

This algorithm primarily analyzes users' historical data to build user models and make recommendations. Collaborative filtering algorithms are mainly divided into two types: User-Based Collaborative Filtering (UserCF) and Item-Based Collaborative Filtering (ItemCF).
