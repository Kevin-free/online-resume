Binary search offers advantages like fast lookup speed and good average performance, but it only works when the list is **sorted**. It is commonly tested in interviews. This article will explain the binary search algorithm.

### Let's start with a scenario

One day, Xiao Ming whimsically borrowed N books from the library. When leaving, the alarm went off, and the security guard stopped Xiao Ming to check which book wasnâ€™t properly checked out. Xiao Ming was about to scan each book through the alarm to find the culprit, but the guard, with a disdainful look, said, "You don't even know binary search?" The guard then divided the books into two piles, checked the first pile through the alarm, which set it off. He continued to divide the pile further... After logN checks, the guard successfully identified the book that triggered the alarm, displaying a look of triumph and mockery. Xiao Ming left with the remaining books, thinking, "The guard really is something!"

Do you find binary search simple?! The concept is indeed straightforward, but there are many details to be mindful of. As Knuth, the inventor of the KMP algorithm, said:

> Although the basic idea of binary search is comparatively straightforward, the details can be surprisingly tricky...

In essence: **The idea is simple, but the details are devilish.**

Next, I will analyze the details you need to watch out for and the clever applications of binary search.
